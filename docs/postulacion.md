# Postulación – Líder de Desarrollo Fullstack (Biometrika)

## Perfil Profesional y Experiencia

I am a Senior Software Developer and Computer Engineer with more than **12 years of experience** designing and implementing robust, scalable, and secure software solutions. My career has been focused on building enterprise-grade backend systems primarily with **C# / .NET**, complemented by strong experience in **microservices architectures**, **RESTful APIs**, and **SQL/NoSQL databases**.

I have successfully led development teams and projects across industries such as **smart cities**, **financial technology**, **logistics**, and **municipal platforms**. In these roles, I have not only designed and developed backend services but also collaborated closely with commercial, support, and administrative teams, ensuring technical alignment with business goals and client needs.

**Core Technical Scope:**

- .NET (ASP.NET Core, Web API, background services)
- Microservices, domain decomposition, async messaging
- CI/CD (Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, pipelines YAML)
- Containers (Docker) & orchestration (Kubernetes)
- Cloud (Azure, AWS, GCP) – cost & performance awareness
- Security (authN/Z, secrets, encryption at rest & in transit)
- Data (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Redis caches, event sourcing patterns)
- Observability (structured logging, metrics, distributed tracing)
- AI integration (predictive scoring, anomaly detection, NLP connectors)

Beyond backend development, I bring **full-stack versatility** (React, Flutter, familiarity with **Blazor**) allowing contribution end-to-end from architecture to delivery. I promote engineering excellence through clean architecture principles, code review discipline, automation, and continuous improvement.

I am passionate about creating technology that solves real-world problems efficiently and sustainably, while fostering innovation and high technical standards within development teams.

## Formación Académica y Desarrollo Continuo

I hold a degree in **Computer Engineering**, which provided a strong foundation in software architecture, algorithms, data structures, networks, and database design. This academic background reinforced principles of **computational efficiency**, **scalability** and **security** that guide my decisions.

**Continuous Learning Highlights:**

- Cloud architecture patterns (Azure Well-Architected, AWS CAF)
- AI model integration (OpenAI / Anthropic APIs, vector search basics)
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Bicep)
- Advanced DevSecOps (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning, secret scanning)
- Performance profiling (.NET analyzers, benchmarking with BenchmarkDotNet)

## Motivación por Biometrika

I am interested in joining Biometrika because it allows me to apply and deepen my experience in **biometrics, image processing, identity verification and digital trust** in a company with proven market presence and innovation leadership in Chile and the region. I have worked on projects using **OpenCV**, fingerprint validation, license plate recognition, and visual analytics for access control and monitoring—giving me both the technical and contextual understanding of identity-centric systems.

Biometrika's portfolio (identity verification, biometric enrolment, electronic signatures, access control, document workflows) aligns directly with my background in building secure, high-availability platforms with regulated data. I’m motivated by the opportunity to:

- Strengthen scalability and resilience of verification services.
- Improve architecture governance and observability across microservices.
- Accelerate feature delivery through well-structured CI/CD and automation.
- Contribute to security posture (encryption strategy, key rotation, compliance logging).
- Mentor teams and help consolidate engineering standards.

**Value I Intend to Add:** Faster iteration cycles, measurable reductions in incident recovery time, improved latency in critical identity endpoints, and structured architectural decision tracking.

## Differentiators / Unique Value Proposition

- Blend of deep backend engineering + architectural leadership.
- Experience interfacing with business stakeholders and pre/post sales support.
- Proven track record modernizing legacy components into service-oriented / event-driven systems.
- Security-first mindset (data classification, least privilege, encryption strategy, audit trails).
- Data-informed decision making (instrumentation + KPIs tied to product outcomes).

## Closing Statement

I see Biometrika as a place where the intersection of **trust, regulated processes, and high-performance engineering** creates meaningful impact. My goal is to help elevate platform robustness and accelerate strategic initiatives while building a collaborative, high-quality engineering culture.
